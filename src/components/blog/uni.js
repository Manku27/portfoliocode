        <h1>Future Engineers!</h1>
        <br/><p>First of all</p>

        <p>By now i expect most of you have realised you are done for, life has played a cruel- cruel joke on you. This isnt the sort of thing you had in mind. :'3</p>
        <br/>
        <p>First thing, you need to chill. Yes, it isn't as difficult to navigate as it seems.</p>
        <p>THE PRIMARY GOAL OF COLLEGE IS THAT YOU NEED TO EXPLORE EVERYTHING, CARRER OPTIONS, ACADEMIC OPTIONS, SOCIAL NUANCES. TRY, TEST, CHANGE, EXPLORE EVERYTHING!</p>
        <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1170154482946080768/pu/img/5PNPjZW5c1Ybiy8F.jpg"

        <p>You will have to decide what you want out of this place.</p>
        <p>Sort it to one of the following: <ul><li>Career/Job</li><li> Prospect of Higher Studies</li><li> possible stream change </li><li> you have business plans and dont care about any of these.</li></ul></p>
        <p>Feel free to interchange among these, you are functioning under the primary goal. </p>
        <h3>1. Career:</h3>
        <p>Broadly speaking, your options are:</p>
        <p><ul><li>Core</li><li>IT</li></ul></p>
        <p>If you are in a non-IT branch, it's very important to deicde if you like a future in core or want to an IT job.</p>
        <h4>How to decide?</h4>
        <p><ul>
        <li>Your interest. A good career is one that keeps you happy and satisfied.</li>
        <li>The possible roles and companies that employ in that department.</li>
        <li>The possiblilty of growth in that field.</li>
        <li>The average salary in that sector satisfies your needs.</li>
        <li>The best way is to talk to seniors and try to do a variety of internships.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The general trend is that people try and decide this very early on and focus themselves on it, without exploring the rest of the options. People like these may get a good job, but i have seen students who picked a job based on "what's trending" and what their friends are doing. Many of them are under medication now, most of them trying for other jobs and courses. It's very important to explore. </p>
        <p>personally i cant make a case for core, i did not like it, you may. If asked, i will ask my friends and add something for that here.</p>
        <h4>If you decide to try for IT jobs</h4>
        <p>The general trend is to get into competitive coding, get very proficient in data structures and algorithms and this lands you a good job.</p>
        <p>This was not for me, i try to make projects with applications, maybe something that helps in solving real-world problems or something i can see in action, like this website.</p>
        <p>I learn the things as and when i need them. I havent landed a high-paying job based on this tac-tick but i am extremely hopeful and satisfied with what I am doing.</p>
        <p>What you can explore as an addition or alternative to competitive coading is:</p>
        <ul><li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Data Science</li>
        <li>Cyber Security</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For folks interested in WebDev, i have added links to free resources which are enough to get you started.</p>
        <p>Make sure to do a lot of projects and internships, they dont have to be from a famed tech-company, it's just the hands on experience that counts, not the name of the company or the stipend.</p>
        <p><a href="">Internshala</a> Is a good place to hunt for internships, (not a paid promotion)</p>
        <p>You can search for project ideas on google. you'll probably get youtube, github, codepen and medium links. They are there, you have to know what you are searching for.</p>
        


        <h1>DOs (Academically):</h1>
        <p>keep the attendance to the minimum required</p>
        <p>Dont spend too much time on stuff you dont need</p>
        <p>Focus on doing the minimum amount of work to complete a formality</p>
        <p>ALWAYS WEAR SHOES TO NON-IT LABS</p>
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/bd2c78d9361a4af18c100e1ad9567b1c/tenor.gif" alt="shoes"/>
        <h1>DONTs (Academically):</h1>
        <p>argue with a professor, sadly they have the power to fail you.</p>
        <p>take class tests, vivas and lab exams casually.</p>
        <p>Get backlogs. However much you hate the subjects, you have to pass them.</p>
        <p>leave papers from current sem for the next sem. The last thing you want to have to do after everyone is done with college is stick around for backlogs, simultaneously jeopardising your job. You want your exams to be over in that very semester. DO NOT CARRY BACKLOGS AT ANY COST</p>
        <p>Forget wearing shoes for non-IT labs</p>

        <h1>DOs (Socially):</h1>
        <p>Make a lot of friends. The greatest resource a university can give you is contacts and friends. Accept everyone, regardless of their financial, emotional, sexual and health status.</p>
        <p>You guys are eligible to vote. It's about time you started reading up and listening to what your government is doing, if you agree or disagree with the policies. Is there a criticism or appreciation called for.</p>
        <p>Read books, learn an instrument, play sports and other games, talk to people, get to know different prespectives on different issues. It will help you grow. </p>
        <p>Make healthy relationships.</p>
        <h1>DONTs (Socially):</h1>
        <p>bully, make fun of, descriminate against ANYONE. It is very hurtful and completely unnecessary.</p>
        <p>get politically or religiously biased. Criticise everyone when needed and dont let your ego get the best of you in a debate. Listen to what the other person has to say, consider it, then disagree with them or agree, acknowledge that you had a different idea and you are considering what they said. Frankly accept if you are not confident about your knowledge in certain topics, everyone cant know everything, dont let your ego have the better of you, there is no shame in this.</p>

        <p>I have seen people in relationships give up good jobs and admission opportunities for their partner.</p>

        <p>For interviws:</p>
        <ul><li>Confidence rewards, not nervousness. They dont care if you were nervous.</li><li>Lying might get you a job now, but it wont do any good later on. I suggest, dont lie.</li></ul>

                <br/>
        <p>The last thing, no one cares if you are unhappy. There is no reward for that. Be happy all the time at any cost.</p>
