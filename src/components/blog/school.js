        <p>People force you to not take school seriously and will have you rather focus on JEE.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Just agree with them on their face , but <strong>DONT</strong> take that advice.</p>
        <p>School is necessary for a 15 year old, if only for social interactions. Students focus so much on PCMB that they actively neglect an all-around development.</p>
        <p>I urge you to play sports and computer games, watch movies, read books, enjoy a hobby and hang out with friends VERY REGULARLY. The kind of mental pressure on students today is not worth the payoff. We are humans, this is not a factory, we are not the product.</p>
        <p>About the OTHER SUBJECTS, such as Physical Education and Computer, those are not unimportant. If you like them, spend time on them, its WORTH IT. Specially Compter, the payoff is huge.</p>
        <p>It's okay to not understand and be comfortable with everything being taught to you immediately, each piece of theory was extensively studied, worked and debated upon- philosophically and physically and accepted while still objected upon by fellow scientists.</p>
        <p><strong>IT IS OKAY TO TAKE YOUR TIME WITH THINGS. IT'S VERY NORMAL TO LEARN AT YOUR OWN PACE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU LEARN THEM, NOT HOW FAST YOU MUG THEM UP.</strong></p>
        <p>Question everything....</p>
        <p>Dont let them kill your passion for science because they started a dumb race.</p>

        <h3> Ask yourself : Why are you so passionate about JEE?</h3>
        <p>Is it an IIT degree you want out of it? Is it a high paying job?</p>
        <p>I am not an IIT student, and i can safely inform you based on the experiences i have had and the people i have met, it's not the end of the world if you dont get into IITs. 
        College should be for exploration (more about that in the next tab).
        People get great jobs outside IITs too, and go on to have good satisfying careers. You dont have to be so hard on yourself.</p>
        <p>If your reasoning is to make your parents proud, theyll be happier if you are happier. They think getting into IITs will give you a good future, you definetly should aim for that, BUT, it's okay if you dont manage to. Theyll still be proud. </p>
        <p>You are not a faliure if you dont get as many marks as you should. You are not a faliure if you dont get any marks at all, just acknowledge it, move on to different things, its important that you live happily, have a satisfying career, not be a robot.Your career isnt more important than your well being.</p>
        
        <h2>About how to study</h2>
        <p>What I see is kids going to school, coaching and private tuitions.</p>
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/68d21273ef9cd5c8d06bd2ea5f3c35a7/tenor.gif" 
        alt="vader" className="aboutdiv-img"/>
        <p>Remember, when you were human..? :'3</p>
        <p>The objective is to learn it, if you can do it once, its enough. I mean, if you understand a topic already, dont spend time on it again and again in different tuitions. If your coaching isnt teaching it to you, ditch it. I'm no fan of "learning in batches" myself. You might think it's not practical to ditch coachings,in that case, what you need to do is do more self study. That is the key, you have tons of free resources on the internet that we didn't, use them. <strong>WORK SMARTER NOT HARDER</strong>. Dont overburden yourself, spend less time commuting and in tuitions, more time thinking and understanding.</p>
        <p> A must read article: <a href= "https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230">Feynman Technique for learning.</a></p>

        <p>Misery doesnt pay off, there is no happily ever after after a miserable time period. No one cares if you are sad.</p>

        <p>So DONT SPEND TIME WALLOWING IN MISERY AND HEARTBREAK. LIVE. BE HAPPY AT ANY COST. AND BE HAPPY CONSTANTLY.</p>
